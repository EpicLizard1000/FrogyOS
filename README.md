# FrogyOS
This Is FrogyOS it's a OS i'm making in my free time in the <a href="https://www.lua.org/home.html">Lua</a> language! While <a href="https://www.lua.org/home.html">Lua</a> is an interpreted language I will make a kernel in a language called rust and then embed lua into it! I will be constantly updating FrogyOS and when the first full version is out I will package it and then release it!
